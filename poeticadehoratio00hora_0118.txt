Α perfect judge will read each work ot* :wit

With the same spirit that its author writ3

Survey the whole, nor seek slight faults to find 235
Where Nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;
N Or lose for that n1aligfiant dull d'elight‚

The gen'rous pleasure ‘to be charm'd with wit.

But in such lays as neither ebb nor flow‚

Correctly cold and regularly low, , 240
That shunfiing faultS, one quiet tenor keep3

We cannot blame indeed—but we may sleep.>

In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts

Is not th’ exactness of peeuliar parts:

'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call, 245

But the joint force and full result of 311.
