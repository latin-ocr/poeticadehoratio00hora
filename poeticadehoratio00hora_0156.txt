Pulpits their sacred satire learn?d to spare, 550
And Vice admir'd to find a flatt'rer there!
Eneourag’d thus, Wit's Titans brav'd the skies,

And the press groan'd with licens'd blasphemies.
These monsterS‚ Critics! with your darts engage‚
Here point your thunder) and exhaust( your rage! ’
Yet shun their fault, who, scaudalously nice, 556
Will needs mistake an author into vice:

All seems infected that th’ iufeeted shy,

As all looks yellow to the jaundic’d eye.

Learn then what morals critics ought to show, 560

For 'tis but a half a judge's task to know.

'T is not enough, taste, judgme‘nr, learning, join3

In all you speak‚ let t-ruth and candour shine;
That not alone what to your sense is due

All may allow; but seek your friendship too. 565 “
