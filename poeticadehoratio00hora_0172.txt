From the same foes at last both felt their doom, 635
And the same age saw Learning fall and Rome.
With Tyranny then Superstition join'd,
As that the body, this enslav'd the mind; ,
Much was believ’d‚ but little understood,
And to be dull was constru'd to be good: 690
A second deiuge Learning thus der-ren,
And the Monks finish’d what the Goths bagad.

At length Erasmus, that great injur'd name,
(The glory of the priesthood‚ and the shamel)
Stemm’d the wild torrent of a barb'rous age, 695
And drove those holy Vandals off the stage. ⁷

But see! each Muse in Leo's golden days
Starts from her nance, and trims her wither'd bays;

Rome’s ancient Genius o’er its ruins spread,

Shakes off the dust, and rears his rev'rend head. 700
