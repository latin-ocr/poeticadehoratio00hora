Oft’, leaving what is natural aud fit,

The cnrrent folly proves the ready wit3

And authors think their reputation safe 450

Which lives as long as fools are pleas'd to laugh.
Some valuing those of their own side or mind,

Still make themselves the, measure of inankind:

Fondly we think we honour merit then,

When we but praise ourselves in other men. 455

Parties in wit attend on those of state,

And public faction doubles private hate.

Pride, malice, folly‚ against Dryden rose

In various shapes of parsoiiS, critics,'beaus; ’ἱ

But sense surviv'd when merry jests were past; 460' ’ ⁷

For rising merit will buo),⁷ up at last.

Might he return, and bless once more our eyeS, ,2'

New Blackmores and new‘Milbourns must arise:

Nay should great Homer list his awfnl* head,

Zoilus again would start up from the dead. *465
