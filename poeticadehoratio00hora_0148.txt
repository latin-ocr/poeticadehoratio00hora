Our sons their fathers' {ailing language see,
And such as Chaucer is, shall Drydeu be.
So when the faithful pencil has design'd ’
Some bright idea of the ‘master' s mindy ι 485
Where a new world leaps out at his command} ”
And ready Nature waits upon his hand3 ᾗ ’ ’
When the ripe colours soften and unite,
And sweetly melt into just shade and light; γ
When mellowing years their full perfectior) give,
And each bold figure just begins to five, > 493

The treach’rous colours the fair art betray,
And all the bright creation fades away!

Unhappy wit, like most mistaken thingS,
Atones not for that envy which it brings. ’ 495
In youth alone its empty praise we boast,
But soon the short-liv’ds’anity is lost;

Like some fair flow’r the early spring supplies,

T hat gaily blooms, but ev’n in blooming dies. .
