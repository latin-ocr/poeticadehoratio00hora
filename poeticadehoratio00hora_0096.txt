Nature to all things fix’d the limits fit, ψ
And wisely curb’d proud man’s pretending wit.
A⁵„⁰¹¹ the land while here the ocean gainS,
In other parts it leaves wide sandy plains; 55
Thus in the soul while memo& prevails, -
The solid pow'r of understanding fails3

Where beams of warm imagination play,
The memory's soft figures melt away.
One science only will one genius fit3 60
So* vast is art, so narrewa¹ human wit:
Not oissy bounded to peculial· arts,
But oft’ in these confiu’d to single parts.

Like kings we lose the conquests gain’d before, -.

By vain ambition still to make them more: ’ 65
