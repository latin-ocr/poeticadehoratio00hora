Yet some there were, among the sounder few

Of those who less presum'd and-better knew, 720
Who durst assert the juster ancient cause,

And here restor’d W it’s fundamental laws.

Such was the Muse whose rules and practice tell

“ N ature's chief masterpiece is writing well.’'

Such was Roscommon, not more learn’d than good,
With manners gen'rous as his noble blood; 726
To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known,
And ev’ry author's merit but his own.

Such late was Walsh—-the Muse's judge and friend,
Who justly knew to blame or to commend3 730
To failings mild, but zealous for desert,

The clearest head, and the sincerest heart.

This humble praise, lamented Shade! receive;
This praise at least a grateful Muse may give:
The M use whose early voice you taught to sing, 735

Prescrib'd her heights, and prun'd her tendet wing,
