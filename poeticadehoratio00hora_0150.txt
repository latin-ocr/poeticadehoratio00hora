What is abis wit which must our cares employ? 500
The owner's wife that other men eujoy3
Then most our trouble still when most admir’d,
And ¹still the more we give, the more requir’d3
NVhose fame with pains we gain, but lose with ease,
Sure some to vex, but never all to please3 505
'Tis what the vicious fear, the virtuous shun3
By fools 'tis hated‚ and by knaves undone!

If wit so much from igu’rance undergo,
Ah let not learning too commence its foe!
Of old, those met rewards who could excel, 510
And such were prais'd who but endeavour'd well:
T ho' triumphs were to gen'rals only due,
Crowns were reserv’d to grace the soldiers too.
Now, they who reach Parnassus’ lofty croWn
Employ tl1einains to spurn some others dowu3 515
And while self-love each jealous writer· rules, Ι

Contending wits become the sport of fools3
