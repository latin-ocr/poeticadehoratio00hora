’Tis more to guide than spur the Muse's steed‚
Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed: 85
The winged emmer, like a gen’rous horse,
Shovvs most true mettle when you check his course.
Those Rules of old, discover’d, not devis’d‚
Are Nature still, but Nature methodiz'dz
Nature, like liberty, is but restrain’d 90
By the same laws which first herself ordain’d.

Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites‚
When 10 repress and when indulge our flights:
High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,
And pointed out those arduous paths they trod3 95
Held from afar, aloft, th’ immorial prize‚ ”
And urg’d the rest by equal steps to rise.
Just precepts thus from great examples giv’n,

She drew from them what they deriv’d from Heav’n.
