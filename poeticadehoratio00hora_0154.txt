When love was all ali easy monarch’s care, · 536
Seldom at counciL never in a war: ᾧ
J ilts rul’d the state, and statesmen farces writ3

Nay wits had pensions‚ and young lords had wit;
The fair sat panting ai a courtier’s play, 540

And not a mask went unimprov’d away:

The modest fan was ‘lifted up no more,

And virgins smil’d at what they blush'd before. ¹.
The following licence of ,a foreign reign
Did all the dregs of bold Socinus drain3 γ 545

Then unbelieving priests reform’d the natiou,
And taught more pleasant methods of salvatio¹13
Where Heav’n's free subjects might their rights dispute‚

Lest God himself should seem too absolute}
