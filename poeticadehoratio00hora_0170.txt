In grave Quintilian’s copious work we find
The justest rules and clearest method join'd. 670
Thus useful arms in magazines we place,
All rang'd in order, a11dffldispos’d with grace3 ,.
ssut less to please the eye than arm the hand,
Still fit for use, and ready at command.
Thee, bold Longinus! all the Nine inspiro, 675
And bless their critic with a poet’s fire:
An ardent judge‚ th zealous in his trust',
With warmth gives sentence, yet is always just;
Whose own example strengthens all his laws,
And is himself that great subliffie he draws. 680

Thus long succeeding critics justly reign'd,
Licence repress'd, and useful laws ordain'd:

Learning and Rome alike in empire grew,

And arts still follow’d where her Engles flew3 .
