’ Be silent alwayS, when you doubt your sense,
And speak‚ tho' suie, with seeming diffidence: ’
Some positive, persisting fps we know,
Who if once wrong, will needs be always so;
But you, with pleasure own your errors past, '- 570
And make each day a critique on the last.
’T is not enough your eounsel still be true,
Blunt truths more mischief that nice falsehoods do:
Men must *be taught as if you taught them not,
And things unknown propos’d as things forgot. 575
without good-breeding‚ truth is disapprovfl}
That only makes superior sense belov'd.
Be niggards of advice on· no pretencffl
For the worst avarice is that of sense·
With mean complacence ne’er betray jour trusi, 5839 ·
Nor be so civil as to prove unjust.
Fear not the anger of ¹the-wise to raise3

'Those best can bear reproof‚ who merit praise. v
