But still the worst with most regret commend,

For each ill author is as bad a friend.

To what base ends, and‘ by what abject ways 520

Are mortals urg'd thro' sacred lust of praise!

Ah! ne'er so dire a thirst of glory boastss

Nor in the critic let the' man be lost.

Good nature and good sense must ever join;

To err is human3 to forgiveldivine. 525
But if in noble minds some dregs remain,

Not yet purg’d off, of spleen and sour disdain,

Discharge that tage on more provoking crimes,

Nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times.

No pardon vile obscenity should find, 530

Tho' wit and art conspire to move your mind3

But dulness with obscenity must prove

As shameful sure as impotence in love.

In the fat age of pleasure, wealth, and ease,

Sprang the rank weed‚ and thriv’d with large increase3
