And all to one lov'd folly sacrifice. ¹

Once on a time, La M ancha's K=1ight, they say,

Made him observe the subject and the plot, 275
The manners, passions‚ unitie83 what hot? 4
All which, exact to mle, were brought about,
VVere but a combat in the lists left out.

“ Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite? 280
