Horace still charms with graceful negligence,
And without method talks us into sense ;
Will, like a friend, familiarly convey 655
The truest notions in the easiest way.
He, who supreme in judgment‚ as in wit,
Might boldly censure as he boldly writ‚
Yet judg’d with coolness‚ tho’ he sung with fire3
His precepts teach but what his works inspire. 669
Our Critics take a contrary extreme,
They judge witti fury, but they write with phlegmg
Nor suffers Horace more in wrong translations
By wits‚ than critics in as wrong quotations.

See Dionysius *Homer's thoughts refine, · 665
And call new beauties forth from ev'ry line!

Fancy and art in gay Petronius please‚

The scholar's learning, with the courtier's ease.
