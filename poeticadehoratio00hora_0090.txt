ESSAY οΝ CRITIGISM.
ΒΥ ALEXANDER POPE.

...Φ- ὃ,

'Tls hard to say if gleater want ef skill
Appear in writing or in judging ill;···
But of the two, less dang'reus ἐξ ῑ11’.οίῖεηοε
To tire our patience than mislead our sense:
Some few in that, b'ut numbers err ⁴in this2 ⁴ 5
Te'n censure wroti‘g for ene who vyrites amiss;
A fool mighp once himself alone expose3
Now one in verse makes many more⁸ in prose.-
'Tis with our judgments as our watches‚ none
Go just alike, yet each believes his own. 10
, 9
In poets as true genius is but rare,
True taste as seldom is the critic's share3

Both must alike from Heav'n derive their light,

These born to judge‚ as well as those to write.
