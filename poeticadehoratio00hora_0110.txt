Those freer beauties, evssn in them, 'seem i'aults. ’,Γ-170
Some figures monstrous and ‘mis-shap'd appear,
Consider’d singly, or beheldtoo near3 ,

Those oft' are stratagems which errois seem3

Nor is it Homer nodS‚ but we that dream. 180
Still green with bays each ancientaltar stands

Above the reach of sacrilegious hands,
