’ ’Twere well might critics still this freedom take,
But Appius reddens at each word you speak‚ 585
And stares tremendouS, with a threat'ning eye,
Like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry.
Fear most to tax an honourable soor,
Whose right it is, uncensur’d, to. be dull :
Such, without wit, are poets when they please, 590
As without learning they can take degrees.
Leave dang'rous truths to unsuccessful selures,
And flattery to fulsome dedicators‚
Whom, when they praise‚ the world believes no more
Than when they promise to 'give seribbling o'er. 595
’Tis best sometimes your censure to restrairr,
And charitably let the dull be vain3
Your silence there is better than your spite,

For who can rail so long as they can write?
