If, where the rules not far enough extend,

(Since rules were made but to promote their end),
Such lucky licence answer to the full

Th’ intent p1opos'd‚ that licence is a rule.

Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take, 150
May boldly deviate from the common track.

From vulgar bouuds with brave disorder part,

And snetch a grace beyond the reach of art,

Which, without passing through the judgment, gains

The beart, and all its end at once attaius. 155 .

Inv prospects thus some objects please our eyeS,
Which out of Nature's common order rise,

The shapeless rock, or hauging precipice.

Great wits sometimes may gloriously offeud,

And rise to faults true critics dare uot mend. 160
But though the Ancients thus their rules invade,

(As kings dispense with laws themselves have made),
ModernS, beware! or if you must offend

Against the precept, ne’er transgress its eod3
