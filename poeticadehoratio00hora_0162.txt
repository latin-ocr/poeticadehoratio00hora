Still humhfing on their drowsy course they keep,
And lash’d so long, like tops, a're lash'd asleep. 601
False steps but help them to renew their race,
As, after stumbling‚ jades will mend their pace.
What crowds of these, impenitently bold,
In sounds and jingling syllables grown old, 605
still run on poeta, in a raging vein, ’
E'en to the dregs and squeezings of the hrain,
Strain out the last dull droppings of their sense,
And rhyme with all the rage ofaimpotence!

Such shameless bards we have3 and yet 'tis true
There are as mad, abandon'd critics too· ὃ] Ι
The bookful blockhead ignorantly read,

With loads of learned lumber in his head,
With his own tongue still edifies his ears,

And always list'ning to himself appears: 615

All books he reads. and all he reads assails,

From Dryden’s Fables down to Durfey's Tales.
