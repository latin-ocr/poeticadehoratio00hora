A little learning is a dang'rous thing3 215
Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:

There shallow draughts intoxicate the hrain, Ι

And drinking largely sobers us again.

Fir’d at first sight with what the Muse impar-m,

ln fearless youth we ten1pt the heights of arts, 220
While, from the bounded level of our mind,

Short views we take, nor see the lengths behi'nd3
But more advanc'd‚ behold with strange surprise,
New distant scenes of endless science rise!

So pleas'd at first the tou’ring Alps we try, 225
Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky!
Th' eternal snows appear already past,

And the first clouds and mountains seem the last:
But, those attain’d, we tremble to survey

The growing labours of the lengthened way3 230
Th' increasing prospect lires our wand²ring eyes,

Hills peep o’er hius, and ⁹Alps on Alps arise!
