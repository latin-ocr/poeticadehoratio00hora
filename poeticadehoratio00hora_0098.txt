Each might his sev’ral province we‘chmnmand,
W ould ail but stoop to what they understand.

First follow Nature, and your judgment frume
By her just standard, which is still the same :-
Unerring nature! still divinely bright, 70
One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,
Life, force, aud beauty, must to all impart,
At once the source, and end, and test, of art.
Art from that fund each just supply provides,
WVorks without show, and without pomp presides: 7 5
In some fair body thus th’ informing soul
With spirits feeds, and vigour fills the whole3
Each motion guides, and ev’ry nerve sustqtns, Α
Itself unseen, but in th' effects remainS.
Some, to ,whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse, 80
Want as much more to turn it to its use;
For wit and judgment often are at strife,

Though meant each other's aid, like man and wife.
