If Maevius scribble in Apollb's spite,

There are who judge still worssse than he can write. 35
Some have at first for wits, then poetS, past,

Turn'd critics next, and prov'd plain fools at last.

Some neither can for wits nor critics pass,

As heavy mules are neither horse nor ass. δ

Those half-learn’d wissings, num'r'ous in our isle, 40

As half-sorm'd insects on the banks of Nile3

Unfinish’d things, one knows not what to call}

Their generation's so equivocal3

To tell them would a hundred tongues require,

Or one vain wit’s, that might a hundred tire. 45
But you who sees} to give and merit fame, Α

And justly bear a Critic’s noble name,

Be sure yourself and your own reach to know,

How far your genius, taste, and learning go; ·

Launch not beyond your depth, but be discreet, 50

And mark that point where sense and dulness meet.
