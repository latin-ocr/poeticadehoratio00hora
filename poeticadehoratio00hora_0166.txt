And gladly praise the merit of a foe3
Bless'd with a taste exact, yet qnconfin'd,
A knowledge both of books and human-kind3 640
Gen’rous converse3 a soul exempt from pride3
And loves to praise, with reason on his side?

Receiv'd his laws; aud stood convinc’d 'twas fit,

Who conquer’d Nature, should preside o’er wit..
