While they ring round the same unvary’d chimes,
With sure returns of still expected rhymes3

W here’er you find “ the cooling western breeze,” :350
In the next line, it “ whispers thro' the trees :'' ¹

If chrystal streams “ with pleasing murmurs creep‚”
The reader’s threateu’d ¹(not iu vain) with “ sleep;''
Then at the last and only couplet fraught

With some unmeaning thing they call a thought, 355

A needless Alexandrine ends the song,

T hat‚like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.
Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know
What’s rouudly smooth‚ or languisbingly slow3

And praise the easy vigour of a line, Χ 360
Ψῑιεῑε Denham’s strength, and Waller’s sweetness join.
True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, .
As those move easiest who have learn’d to dance.
’Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,

The sound must seem an echo to the sense. 365
