Let such teach others who themselves excel, 15
And censure freely who have written well.
Authors are partial to their wit, ’tis true, ¹
But are not critics to their judgment too?

Yet if we look more closely, we shall find
Most have the seeds of judgment in their mind: 20
Nature affords at least a 'glimrn'ring liglit3 ς
The lines though touch'd but faintly are drawn rightz
But as the slightest sketch, if justly trac'd,
Is by ill-colouring but the more disgrec’d,
So by false learning is good sensedefac'd: 25
Some are bewilder’d in the maze of school&
And some made coxcombs Nature meant but fools.
In search of wit these lose* their eommon sense

And then turn critics in their own defence:

Each burns alike who can or cannot write, < 30 .

Or with a rival's or an eunuch’s §pita
All fools have still an itching πο deride,
And fain would be upon the laughing side.
