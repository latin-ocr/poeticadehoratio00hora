False eloquence, like the prismatic glass‚.'
Its gaudy colours spreads on ev’ry place 3·
The face of Nature we no more suwey, ,
All glares alike‚ without distinction gay; =
But true expression, like th’ unchanging sun, -3152
Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon3
It gilda· all objectS‚ but it alters none.
Expression is the dress of thought, and still ·
Appears more decent as more suitable,
A vile conceit iu pompeiis words express'd‚ 32&
Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:
For diff' rent styles with diff'rent subjecte sort, .
As several garbs with country, town, and court.
Some by old words to fame have made pretence,
Ancients in phrase, mere Moderns in their sense: „n'
Such labour'd nothiugs in so strange a style 326
Amaze th' unlearn'd and make the learned smile-
Unlucky as Fungoso in the play,
These sparks with avsjkward vanity display

What the fine gentleman wore yestegdayy θ 336.
