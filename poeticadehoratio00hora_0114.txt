To teach vain wits a science little known, ·

T ’ ‚admire superior sense, and doubt their own! ¹ 200

OF all the causes which conspire to blind

Man’s erring' judgment‚ and ffisguffleffle mind,
What the weak head wi'th strongest biatu> gules,

Is pride, fflexnever-failing vice of fools.

Whatever Natnre-Nhas in {vo'rth deny'd, 205
She gives in large reeffiits of needfu} pride:

For as in bodies, thus in sauls, we find

ἱ What wants in-blood and spirits, swell’d with wind:
Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,

And fills up all the mighty void of sense: 210
If enee right reason drives that cloud away,

Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.

Trust not yourself3 but your defects to know,

Make use of ev'ry friend—and ev’ry foe.
