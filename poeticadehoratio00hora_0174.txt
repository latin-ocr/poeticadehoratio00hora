Then Sculpture and her sister-arts revive3
Stones leap’d to form, and rocks began to live;
With sweeter notes each rising temple rung3
A Raphael painted, and a Vida sung:
Immortal Vida! on whose honour'd brow Β ’ '705
The poet's bays and critie’s ivy grow!
Cremona now shall ever boast thy name,
And next in place to Mantua, next in fame!
But soon by impious arms from Latium chae’d,⁸

Their ancient bonnds the banish'd Muses pass'd: 710

Thence aris o'er al} the northern world advance‚
But critic-learning flourish'd most in France:
The rules a nation born to serve obeys,
And Boileau still in right of Horace swaye.
But we, brave Britons! foreign laws despis'd‚ 715

And kept unconquer’d and unciviliz'd3

Fiet-ce for the liberties of wit, and bold,

We still defy'd the Romans, as of old.
