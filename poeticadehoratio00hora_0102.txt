The gen'rous critic fann’d the poet’s sire, 100
And taught the world with reason to admire-

Theu Criticism the Muse’s handmaid prov’d,

To dress her charms, aud make her more belov'd ;
But following wits from that intention stray’d3

Who could not Win the mistress woo'd the maid3 105
Against the poets their own arms they turn'd‚

Sure to hate most the meu from whom they learn'd.
So modern 'pothecaries, taught the art θ’.
By doctors' bills to play the doctor’s part,

Bold in the piactice of mistaken rules, 1 10
Prescribe, apply‚ and call their masters fools.

Some on the leaves of ancient au'thors prey3

Nor time nor moths e'er sfioil'd so much as they: “
Some dryly plain, without Invention's aid‘,

Write dull receipts how poems may be made; 115
