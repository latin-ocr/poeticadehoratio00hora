Persians and Greeks like turns os Nature found, 380
And the world's victor stood subdu'd by sound!
The pow’r of music all our hearts allow,
And what Timotheus was, is Dryden now.
Avoid extreme33 and shun the fault of such,
Who still are pleas’d too little or too much3 385
At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence,
*That always shows great pride, or little sense:
Those heads, as stomachS‚ are not sure the best,
Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.
Yet let not each gay turn thy raptare move3 390
For fools admire, but men of sense appi-ove:
As things seem large which we through mists desmy,
Dulness is eyer apt to magnify.

Some foreign writers, some our own despise3

The Ancients only, οι· the Moderns prize. 395
