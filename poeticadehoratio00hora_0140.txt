A constant critic at the great man’s board,

To fetch and carry nonsense sor my Lord.
What woful stuff ghis madrigal would be

In some starv'd hackney sonnetteer, or me! ⁵

’ But let a lord once own the happy lines, 420 ·

How the wit brightens'! how the style refines!
Before his sacred name flies ev’ry fault, ι
And each exalted stanza teems with thought!

The vulgar thus through imitation err;
¹ As oft the learn'd by being singulam 425
So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng
By chance go right, they purposely go wrong:
So schismatics the plain believers quit,
And are but damn’d for having too much wit.
Some praise at morning what they blm? at night3
But always think the last opinion right, 431
A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd,

This hour she’s idoliz'd, the next abus'd
